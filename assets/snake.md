Rules of the game `Snake`
=========================

## How to Quit
   >Press the **Q** key at any time to exit the game.

## Object of the game
   >Survive by eating prey and avoiding obstacles and predators until the snake grows long enough to return to its home.

## How to Play
1. How to Move
   >The snake begins on the left side of the screen moving toward the right in a straight line.
   
   >Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to change the direction the snake is moving.
      - Pressing the arrow key in the same direction as the snake is moving will cause it to speed up.
      - Pressing the arrow key in the opposite direction as the snake is moving will cause it to slow down.
      
   >When the snake changes direction, the head will change direction immediately but the rest of the body will continue to move in the direction it was moving until it reaches the place where the head changed direction.
   
2. How to eat
   - The snake eats mice, bugs, and berries by running over them.
   Each time the snake eats, it will grow longer.
   - The snake will be eaten if it runs into predators such as birds or dogs.
   
3. How to win
   - The game ends when the snake runs into something--either an obstacle, a predator, or itself.
   - The snake wins the game by entering its burrow.
   
   >The burrow appears on the map when the snake's length equals the width of the screen.
