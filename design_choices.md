#Design choices for the game *Snake*

(In no particular order)
- Client/server, or command line?
- Language?
- Single or multi-player?--a longer snake can eat shorter snakes?

"Always design one to throw it away--you will anyway"

Figure out how to:
- create the snake's environment in a terminal
- display the snake in the environment
- make the snake move in the environment using the arrow keys

For a first attempt, I'm going to use python, on the command line, as a single-player game.
